At first we have to know what is Liquid. Liquid is a simple template programming language used in Shopify to create and customize online store themes. Here are the basics:

1. **Purpose**: Liquid helps you display and manage content in a Shopify store. It decides what shows up on the page and how it looks.

2. **Tags and Filters**: Liquid uses tags to perform tasks (like showing or hiding content) and filters to modify the content (like changing text to uppercase).

3. **Variables**: Liquid can store data in variables, like the name of a product or the price, and use it later on the page.

4. **Loops**: Liquid can repeat actions, like showing a list of products, using loops.

5. **Conditionals**: Liquid can make decisions using conditionals, like showing a message if a product is out of stock.


Overall, Liquid is a template programming language that allows you to build dynamic and flexible Shopify themes by mixing HTML with Liquid tags. Now you can ask me what is template programming language. Actually a template programming language is a type of language used to create and format documents, webpages, or other content by combining static templates with dynamic data. Here's a simple explanation:

1. **Templates**: Templates are pre-designed layouts or structures that define how the final output should look. They contain static parts (which don't change) and placeholders for dynamic parts (which do change).

2. **Dynamic Data**: This is the content that can change, such as product names, prices, or user information. The dynamic data is inserted into the placeholders within the template.

3. **Combining Static and Dynamic**: The template programming language combines the static template with the dynamic data to produce the final content. For example, it can take a product name and price and insert them into a template to create a complete product page.

4. **Example**: In the context of Shopify and Liquid, you might have a template for a product page. The static parts could be the HTML structure, and the dynamic parts could be the product details like name, price, and description. Liquid inserts the actual product details into the template to generate the final product page that customers see.


In summary, a template programming language allows you to create flexible and reusable designs by separating the layout (template) from the content (dynamic data). This makes it easier to manage and update content across many pages or documents.


### Now we will be familiar with Tag and filters:

#### Tag
Liquid tags are used to perform logical operations and control the flow of the template. Text within tag delimiters doesn’t produce visible output when the webpage is rendered. Tags are enclosed in `{% %}`.

```liquid
 {% assign product_name = product.title %}
{{ product_name }}

```

#### Filter:

Filters in Liquid are used to modify the output of variables. They are applied using the pipe character `|`. Here are some common Liquid filters with examples:

##### Basic Syntax:
```liquid
{{ variable | filter }}
```

##### Capitalize
```liquid
{{ "shopify" | capitalize }}
```

Output:
```sh
Shopify
```

##### Uppercase :
```liquid
{{ "shopify" | upcase }}
```

 Output: 
 ```sh
 SHOPIFY
```

Now here you can tell me where use {% ---- %} then where you will use {{ ---- }}?

The answer is in Liquid, the `{% %}` and `{{ }}` delimiters serve different purposes:
### `{% %}`: Use on Logic Tags

These are used for control flow and logic operations. They do not produce any visible output on the page. Instead, they control what Liquid does behind the scenes. Examples include `if`, `for`, `assign`, and `include`.

- **`if` Statements**:
```liquid
{% if product.available %}
  This product is available.
{% endif %}
```

- **`for` Loops**:
```liquid
{% for product in collection.products %}
  {{ product.title }}
{% endfor %}
```
- **`assign` Variables**:
```liquid
{% assign product_name = "Blue Shirt" %}
```
- **`include` Snippets**:
```liquid
{% include 'header' %}
```

### `{{ }}`: Output Tags

These are used to output content to the page. They print the value of variables and expressions.

- **Output Variables**:
```liquid
{{ product.title }}
```
- **Apply Filters**:
```liquid
{{ product.price | money }}
```
- **Output Captured Content**:
```liquid
{% capture greeting %}Hello, {{ customer.first_name }}!{% endcapture %}
{{ greeting }}
```

### When to Use Each

- Use `{% %}` for logic and control flow:

- `if` conditions
- `for` loops
- `assign` statements
- `include` tags
- Use `{{ }}` for outputting content to the page:

- Display variable values
- Output filtered values
- Print dynamic content based on logic

### Example Combining Both

Here’s a simple example that combines both logic tags and output tags:

```liquid
{% assign discount_price = product.price | minus: 5 %}

{% if product.available %}
  <p>{{ product.title }} is available at a discounted price of {{ discount_price | money }}!</p>
{% else %}
  <p>{{ product.title }} is currently out of stock.</p>
{% endif %}
```

In this example:

- `{% assign discount_price = product.price | minus: 5 %}` is a logic tag that calculates the discounted price.
- `{% if product.available %}` is a logic tag that checks if the product is available.
- `<p>{{ product.title }} is available at a discounted price of {{ discount_price | money }}!</p>` uses output tags to display the product title and the discounted price if the product is available.
- `<p>{{ product.title }} is currently out of stock.</p>` uses an output tag to display a message if the product is out of stock.

By using `{% %}` and `{{ }}` appropriately, you can control both the logic and the display of your Liquid templates.
