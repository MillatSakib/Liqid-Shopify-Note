In Liquid, operators are used to perform operations on variables and values, such as comparisons and arithmetic. Here are some of the most common Liquid operators with examples:

### Comparison Operators

1. **Equality (`==`)**
- Checks if two values are equal.
```liquid
{% if product.title == "Blue Shirt" %}
  This is a Blue Shirt.
{% endif %}
```
2. **Inequality (`!=`)**

- Checks if two values are not equal.
```liquid
{% if product.title != "Red Shirt" %}
  This is not a Red Shirt.
{% endif %}
```
3. **Greater Than (`>`)**

- Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
```liquid
{% if product.price > 50 %}
  This product is expensive.
{% endif %}
```
4. **Less Than (`<`)**

- Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
```liquid
{% if product.price < 20 %}
  This product is cheap.
{% endif %}
```
5. **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**

- Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
```liquid
{% if product.price >= 100 %}
  This product is premium.
{% endif %}
```
6. **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**

- Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.
```liquid
{% if product.price <= 30 %}
  This product is affordable.
{% endif %}
```

### Logical Operators

1. **And (`and`)**
- Checks if both conditions are true.
```liquid
{% if product.available and product.price < 50 %}
  This product is available and affordable.
{% endif %}
```
2. **Or (`or`)**

- Checks if at least one condition is true.
```liquid
{% if product.title == "Blue Shirt" or product.title == "Red Shirt" %}
  This product is either a Blue Shirt or a Red Shirt.
{% endif %}
```

### Contains Operator

- **Contains (`contains`)**
- Checks if a string or an array contains a specific substring or element.
```liquid
{% if product.title contains "Shirt" %}
  This product is a type of shirt.
{% endif %}
```
### Arithmetic Operators

1. **Addition (`+`)**
- Adds two numbers.
```liquid
{% assign total = product.price | plus: 10 %}
Total price with extra charge: {{ total }}
```
2. **Subtraction (`-`)**

- Subtracts one number from another.
```liquid
{% assign discount_price = product.price | minus: 5 %}
Discounted price: {{ discount_price }}
```

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**

- Multiplies two numbers.
```liquid
{% assign bulk_price = product.price | times: 10 %}
Price for 10 items: {{ bulk_price }}
```

4. **Division (`/`)**

- Divides one number by another.
```liquid
{% assign average_price = total_price | divided_by: 5 %}
Average price per item: {{ average_price }}
```

5. **Modulo (`%`)**

- Finds the remainder after division of one number by another.
```liquid
{% assign remainder = total_items | modulo: 3 %}
Remainder when total items are divided by 3: {{ remainder }}
```

### Combining Operators

You can combine operators to create more complex conditions and calculations.

```liquid
{% if product.available and product.price < 50 and product.title contains "Shirt" %}
  This available product is an affordable shirt.
{% endif %}
```

### Summary

Operators in Liquid help you perform comparisons, logic operations, and arithmetic on variables and values. They are essential for creating dynamic and conditional content in your Shopify store.

Feel free to experiment with these operators in your Liquid templates to get a better understanding of how they work!
