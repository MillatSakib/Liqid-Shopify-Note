### What is a Handle?

A handle in Shopify is like a nickname for a product, collection, page, or blog post. This nickname is unique and is based on the title of the item. Handles are used to find and display these items in your Shopify store.

### How Handles Are Created

1. **Remove Capital Letters**: Everything is in lowercase.
2. **Replace Spaces with Hyphens**: Spaces between words become hyphens.

For example:

- **Product Title**: "Red T-Shirt"
- **Handle**: "red-t-shirt"

### Why Handles Are Important

Handles make it easy to reference and work with items in your Shopify store using Liquid (Shopify's template language). Think of a handle as an address or a key that lets you find a specific item.

### Examples

1. **Product Handle**:
- Product Title: "Blue Jeans"
- Handle: "blue-jeans"
- Use in Liquid:

```liquid
{% assign product_handle = "blue-jeans" %}
{% assign product = all_products[product_handle] %}
{{ product.title }}  <!-- Outputs: Blue Jeans -->
```

2. **Collection Handle**:

- Collection Title: "Summer Sale"
- Handle: "summer-sale"
- Use in Liquid:
```liquid
{% assign collection_handle = "summer-sale" %}
{% assign collection = collections[collection_handle] %}
{{ collection.title }}  <!-- Outputs: Summer Sale -->
```

3. **Page Handle**:

- Page Title: "About Us"
- Handle: "about-us"
- Use in Liquid:
```liquid
{% assign page_handle = "about-us" %}
{% assign page = pages[page_handle] %}
{{ page.content }}  <!-- Outputs the content of the "About Us" page -->
```

### Using Handles in URLs

Handles are also part of the URLs in your Shopify store, making them easy to read and understand.

- Product Page URL: `https://yourstore.com/products/red-t-shirt`
- Collection Page URL: `https://yourstore.com/collections/summer-sale`
- Page URL: `https://yourstore.com/pages/about-us`

### Summary

- A handle is a unique, simplified nickname for an item.
- It is created from the item's title by making everything lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens.
- Handles are used to find and display items in your Shopify store using Liquid.

Think of handles as simple, unique names that help you easily find and work with different items in your store.

**Now you can ask a question. In Product example if the product name is "Blue Shirt" then the handle will "blue shirt". But there have duplication of Product name of "Blue shirt". But we know handle are always unique. Now how can the handle works here?**

The ans. is Handles are indeed unique identifiers in Shopify, and they are crucial for making sure each product, collection, or page has its own distinct reference. When there are duplicate names, Shopify automatically manages this by adding numbers to the end of the handle to ensure uniqueness.

Here's how Shopify handles duplicates in product names:

### Example:

If you have two products with the name "Blue Shirt":

1. **First Product**:

- Product Name: "Blue Shirt"
- Handle: "blue-shirt"

2. **Second Product**:

- Product Name: "Blue Shirt"
- Handle: "blue-shirt-1"

### Explanation:

- Shopify adds a number (`-1`, `-2`, etc.) to the end of the handle for each duplicate name.
- This ensures that each handle is unique, even if the product names are the same.
- Handles are used internally by Shopify to identify and manage each product, so customers won't see the handle directly on your website.

### Why Handles Are Important:

Handles help Shopify and your website:

- **Organize Products**: Each product can be easily found and managed.
- **Create URLs**: Handles are part of the web address (URL) for each product page, making them SEO-friendly and easy to share.

So, even if you have multiple products with the same name like "Blue Shirt," Shopify's unique handling of handles ensures smooth operation and clarity in managing your store's content.
