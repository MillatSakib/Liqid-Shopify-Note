Liquid syntax are fully dependent on Tags. Syntax tag are define how Liquid code are proceed and rendered. Some important syntax are given bellow: 

### 1. Comment
We know comment are prevent to execute the code we write. In liquid any text inside `comment` tags won't be output, and any Liquid code will be parsed, but not executed. There are two type of comment. Like 
- Single Line Comment. 
- Multi line comment. 
#### Single Line comment
The syntax of single line comment are 
```liquid
{% # content %}
```
### Multi line Comment
The syntax of Multi line comment are 
```liquid
{% comment %}
  content
{% endcomment %}
```

A Hybrid example are given below: 
```liquid
{% # this is a comment %}

{% # for i in (1..3) -%}
  {{ i }}
{% # endfor %}

{%
  ###############################
  # This is a comment
  # across multiple lines
  ###############################
%}
```

We can also write inline comment like below
```liquid
{% liquid
  # this is a comment
  assign topic = 'Learning about comments!'
  echo topic
%}
```

### echo
`echo` also like the expression `{{ -expression- }}`. You can print any value of expression using `echo`. 

**CODE**
```liquid
{% echo product.title %}
{% liquid
  echo product.price | money
%}
```

**OUTPUT**
```sh
Health potion
$10.00
```

###  liquid
I can't understand liquid tag


### raw
If you want to  output the liquid code then you have to use `raw` tag. The syntax of raw tag are given below:
```liquid
{% raw %}
  expression
{% endraw %}
```
And example of `raw` tag are given below:
Code:
```liquid
{% raw %}
{{ 2 | plus: 2 }} equals 4.
{% endraw %}
```
Output:
```sh
{{ 2 | plus: 2 }} equals 4.
```
